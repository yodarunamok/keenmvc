# KeenMVC         {#mainpage}

**Keen** was born from my search for an MVC framework with all the *good* bits.  What are the good bits?  Here's my take (YMMV):

* Fast, Flexible, Powerful
* Inferred Models -- this one isn't too hard to find
* Lightweight -- it's so easy to go too feature-heavy
* Easy for Newcomers -- we've all been there
* View / Controller Separation  -- this one I couldn't find

The last two were the key.

I don't know of anyone who was born a programmer. We all started somewhere. And yet, a very high percentage of the tools designed for programmers are not friendly to newbies. For example, I actually feel that Ruby would be somewhat easier than PHP to pick up. (There's even a Ruby framework called [Pakyow](https://www.pakyow.org/) with the "good bits".) Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a server application in the Ruby world that's as easy to work with as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).


And then views. I wanted to be able to take an unmodified HTML file and plug it in. No templating languages. No inserting bits of code. A view is just a view. To me, a framework that lacks this is not *really* an MVC framework. [Pakyow](https://www.pakyow.org/) is the only framework I'm aware of that does this.

All that said, I felt like it would be easier for me to create a framework for PHP (where I know there's a need for such a thing),  than to create a desktop server app for Ruby. Enter KeenMVC.
